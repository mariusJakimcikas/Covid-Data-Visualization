# Covid-Data-Visualization
This is a very timely project that creates a visualization of COVID-19 data in California coming from John Hopkins University.

The project creates two graphs that are very similar to the plots on the internet and all the news channels about the current statistics
and trends with COVID-19 pandemic.

One graph is plotted on the map of California and shows deaths/infections by county. The second graph shows the number of new deaths/infections
each day for one particular county, and in comparison to statewide statistics.

# Details

The total deaths are shown as a circle whose size is proportional to its value and whose location is geographically located over the county.
The daily number of deaths are shown as a bar chart. The line chart displays a 7-day rolling average. Both charts are shown over the top of a
shaded line chart that displays the 7-day rolling average for all of California. The graphs also has two labels that provide the total number
of deaths to date in the state of California and also for the specified county.

# Output

The two plots are displayed side-by-side.
